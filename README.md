# Credit Card Fraud Detection

In this project, various machine learning models were created using a dataset obtained from the Kaggle website (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). Each model was developed using different machine learning algorithms (Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, GBM, ANN). The project aimed to perform binary classification.

The confusion matrix of the created models was extracted, and parameters such as Accuracy, F-1, Precision, and Recall were evaluated and compared. The AUC value and ROC curve were also evaluated as success criteria.
